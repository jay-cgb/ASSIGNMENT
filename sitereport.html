       <div class="moduleexperience">
         <h2>Module experience/overview - Introduction</h2>
         <p>This was my first experience in Web Development, and from my first term experience, I must say I am enjoying the module.</p>
         
         <p>From the first term lectures, there were a lot of exercises and topics that I found quite straight forward. For example, topic 5 which goes through how to create animations using CSS.</p>
        
         <p>And then a few other things that were not as straight forward initially, like using GitHub.</p>

         <p>what I did was that I repeatedly went through the lecture notes, watched the lecture videos and did the exercises for the topic until I fully understood how to use GitHub.</p>
        
         <p>I decided to do this because I believe it is very important to know how to use GitHub because firstly, I knew that I needed to use it to manage my code in the assignment and secondly, it is a very beneficial platform to use when working on a project with other people at university or a professional workplace.</p>
        
         <p class="debug">For the debugging process, I used a validator on each development stage of my website to check both my HTML and CSS codes for errors, and when I found any errors, I would fix them immediately. It was important to do this for each development stage of my website because sometimes some invalid code may display fine especially when using CSS.</p>
       </div>

       <div class="websitedesign">
         <h2>Website Design/Structure</h2>
         <p>On the <b>9th of November 2020</b>, I started working on the assignment and because this was my first time creating a website, the plan was to not over complicate things, with the idea of creating a simple but elegant website.</p>
         
         <p class="theme">I decided to go with a dark themed website, which has black and dark grey background colours. Having a background with such colours helps to make the page content which is written in white text stand out. This was inspired by the idea of having a simple but elegant website as I believe the black, grey and white colours complement each other.</p>
        
         <p class="portfoliopagedesign">For my portfolio page design, I decided to use images that represent the different modules or have some relation to the modules. The images help to give the visitors a visual understanding of what the module is about, which can then be clicked on, to find out more information about the module and the work done in the modules. Most importantly, the images used are bright, eye-catching coloured images in order to capture the visitor’s attention, encouraging them to click the images and explore the website more in general.</p>
        
         <p>Furthermore, the dark background of my website and the bright coloured images used in my portfolio page, contrasts each other very well, allowing the images to stand out even more.</p>
         
         <p class="font">The general font that I used for my website was a font called ‘Roboto’. This font is an amazing, easy to read font. I went for it because it makes my website look clean and modern, which supports the elegant design I am trying to have for my website.</p>
         
         <p class="overalllayout">An important thing I had to consider when designing my website was to make sure that all the pages had the same overall layout/structure and the only thing that would be different on each page is the page content. so, the header navigation menu and footer layout are the same across the different pages. This meant that I would not have to worry about my website looking unorganised.</p>
         
         <p>In addition to this, another thing I had to consider with the design of my website was to make sure that I used a hamburger icon to hide the menu when the page is switched from a desktop version to a mobile version.</p>
       </div>
       
       <div class="relevantchanges">
         <h2>Relevant changes made</h2>
         <p>In the process of creating my website, there were certain designs that I was fine with at first because I thought it looked nice for the website. However, as I progressed, I realised that I could make some relevant changes to make the initial design even better.</p>
         <p>For example, the first image below is a screenshot showing how my home page looked previously, the second image is another screenshot showing the design I ended up with. This change happened on the <b>20th of November 2020</b>, and one of the differences between the previous stage and the current stage shown below is that in the current stage I decided to make the text evenly centred because I felt it looked cleaner and better. I also decided to change the font for the paragraph after my name from ‘Roboto’ to a font called ‘Nerko One’ because I wanted the welcome message to be a little bit informal, hence why I used a font that I would describe as a ‘playful’ font for this part. The idea behind this is that when people visit my website, the first page they will see is the home page and using a ‘playful’ and informal font will make them feel more comfortable and welcomed prompting them to view and explore the rest of my website.</p>

         <h2>HTML & CSS Validation</h2>
         <p class="intro">This is the validation report section for my website. The final Validation process took place on the <b>8th of December 2020.</b></p>
         <p class="explain">Below are screenshots which shows the validation result for the HTML and CSS codes used in creating the different pages on my website. In the screenshots you can see that the codes are valid and have no errors. They are in the following order: HTML results, Desktop CSS results and Mobile CSS results for each of the different pages.</p>
